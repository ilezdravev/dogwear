Being a dog mom, I stopped to wonder why I would cook healthy, nourishing food at home for my family and not include my much loved dog in the equation. Having built deep engagement in the dog community when founding Love Puppies in 2016, a sister not-for-profit that stops the inhumane treatment of dogs at puppy mills, Dog Child was born out of my desire to make cooking at home for our pet easier than ever. Through Dog Child, we aim to empower dog parents to care for their pets as a member of the family — by cooking meals with the peace of mind that their wellbeing is covered, and we are truly giving our pets the very best. <\/p>",
